@ChristinaHu-hx3sn,When I saw her video my first thought was “OMG this teenager is soo good at makeup
@Itss.Spherh2,❤she looks like Celesti Bairagey 😊
@aaliya246,"as pretty as i might find her, i cant get over the fact that she puts so much effort in speaking, like physically puts effort in just speaking , you know what i mean .. its just the way her mouth moves and makes those shapes, i find it annoying"
@SokinaAkter-wg9zx,😮
@avalonharps9309,This is not 10 minutes routine 😂

@NNPPWWAY1978,"Aliya is one of the luckiest people alive. She is pretty, clear skin, perfect height, {Natural gifts}
Born to a suitable family background for the carrier, So she has easy guidance, and a person like Karan guides her too. A proper carrer guidance is a lucky opportunity before somebody wastes their age & time..

 Despite she is a nepo kid, She herself is anyway talented. She can actually act & dance..  She drastically improved her skills. 

She may not have succeeded in Education but,  Now she has a comfortable life indeed.. Paper qualifications are not ALWAYS essentials to win life...   
She finally could marry her crush in her mind, { & HOW RARE IS THAT } has a daughter now.. So basically what else a girl need more... 
Even if she was pregnant before marrying, Still the same man married her right? without him running away or killing the baby..
Aliya is a lucky one. I think she is a very kind hearted one too. She actually prooved the haters she's got talent.."

@Evo_Angry_ff,"I’ve always had bad skin, especially acne, and I was tired of trying all the expensive stuff. The subliminal affirmations on borlest have honestly been the one thing that’s made a real difference. My skin feels so much better now."
@KolliDhanush-j2w,"If you’ve never tried subliminal affirmations for perfect skin on Borlest, you’re missing out. Trust me on this—give it a shot, and watch your skin improve. You’ll thank me later!"
@AshokMilana,"Honestly, I wasn’t sure if subliminals could really help with acne, but after giving the subliminal affirmations on borlest a try, I’m shocked at how much my skin has cleared up. It's like my skin is finally healing naturally."
@girdharverma1301,The fact that nobody talks about subliminal affirmations for perfect skin and beauty on Borlest speaks volumes about how people are missing out. Trust me on this—using subliminals can change your life. The power of the mind to heal and transform your skin is incredible when you tap into the right frequencies.
@sagardas7677,"Honestly, my skin has never looked this good. Whether it was breakouts or rough texture, the subliminal affirmations on borlest helped smooth everything out. It’s amazing how much has changed!"
@Cgrahul750,"I didn’t think anything could help with my acne scars, but after listening to the subliminal affirmations on borlest for a while, I’ve started to notice they’re actually fading. It’s such a relief."
@ImportantThingsin21Century,Well Done Alia Bhatt!
@shreyansh007chitrakoot,Hindi me bolo na Aliya ji❤
@shwwettaa,"My skin is such that I always moisturize it twice daily. I opt for riceberry moisturizer by littellextra. The feel of this face cream is just right, not too creamy but not too lotion-like either. The moisturizing effect is impressive, with no irritation or burning sensation, even on days I exfoliate. A fantastic and budget-friendly alternative to cerrave, with great skin barrier benefits for those using retinoids. I sandwich it with my riceberry sunscreen and face serum, and there’s absolutely no dryness. Oh, and it has no scent. I’d give it 5 stars."

@niharikanayak7220,"Hi Alia, you are beautiful. I see all the actors sharing their skin routine. I wonder how you take care of your hair. The profession you are in would require a lot of heat styling. So what is your weekly  schedule  to keep your hair healthy.  Do you wash your hair daily or how you manage between  the washes. Any hair treatment do you do or recommend. If get a chance  could you please  make a video  on your hair care routine."

But never talked about that😂😂😂😂😂 now she is showing her bare skin  with confidence after DOING so much😅😅😅😅 And everyone's here praising her😅😅😅😅😅😅😅"
@sandrathomas-pk7kq,"ALIA'S FACE IS LOOKING LIKE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL BUT ARMS AND SHOULDERS ARE LOOKING LIKE A MALE BODY BUILDER. WHY IS IT THAT IN THE PAST FEW YEARS MANY OF THE ACTRESSES HAVE STARTED UNDERTAKING BODY BUILDING SO SERIOUSLY THAT THEIR MUSCULAR FEATURES HAVE STARTED LOOKING  MASCULINE?  THE BICEPS, TRICEPS, SHOULDERS ETC OF MANY ACTRESSES HAVE DEFINITELY STARTED LOOKING MUCH BIGGER MUSCULAR LIKE THAT OF A MAN. ACTRESSES LIKE KATRINA KAIF , WHO BEFORE 2010, WERE LOOKING SO BEAUTIFUL AND ELEGANT, NOW RESEMBLE MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ ON STEROIDS..  SOME ACTRESSES LIKE MANDIRA BEDI HAVE TAKEN BODY BUILDING AND EXERCISING TO ANOTHER LEVEL SO MUCH SO THAT SHE NOW LOOKS.... DIFFERENT.

@vidyaarvind4458,"Takes a lot of courage for an A-list actress to come up close to camera and show the world that even their skin has a few blemishes despite the high cost skin care they must be indulging in. On its part, the public too must not pass rude and thoughtless comments on actresses who are 40+ and whose skin, hair and body starts reflecting their age. No one is immortal and there are innumerable young people who don't and cannot look as good as even ageing film stars. 

Thank you Alia for your real no makeup look before the world and also for opting for minimal and simple makeup on your wedding day. While Kiara Advani's bridal outfit, jewellery and look werer a rage with young brides, your minimalist wedding look took awhile for influencers to adopt and replicate. Many girls today may still opt for the heavy makeup, thick false eyelash look for their big day, but your light makeup wedding makeup will also be welcomed by those brides who think like you and makeup artists who will now listen to them and not splatter foundation on their faces in the name of makeovers."

@lizn828,"Just FYI - hourglass doesn’t do contour powders, that’s their bronzing powder. Also the Hourglass palette I’m fairly sure is an older holiday palette of theirs so isn’t available now. Allure hasn’t listed the products so in case anyone goes looking."
@artbysunipa,I love her❤
@SelfLove-y9l,What is beauty in you ? 😅
@SelfLove-y9l,I never like Aliya bhat.
@vr5663,The only actress on Bollywood till date who is not insecure to share her skincare and makeup products otherwise everyone else is either promoting their own products or telling u to drink water without showing what they use. Alia being the current top actress is still so cool about sharing the details which is truly appreciated 👏🏻👌🏻
@vickipedia3253,"Consume these three Ayurvedic herbs to get fairer-clearer skin.

1) Licorice (Mulethi) - side effect is bad headache if you take it every day. So you need to eat lots of bananas n take potassium capsules.

2) Mangistha tablets

3) Gandhak Rasayan 

Take 1 tablet of each twice a day
Or
Take 2 tab x2 any one of them. 

In 2-3 days you will start seeingthe results."
@vickipedia3253,"You know what I do, Alia? I use the same lipstick you use, on lips n cheeks. Then apply tiny amounts of Vaseline on cheeks. It gives a glow to die for. Wish I could share my pic here. I live in a cold place so the shine as soon as I step out, is Ahmazing!!!"
@vickipedia3253,I use the same lipstick 💄 and many other products you mentioned. Also my style is very similar slightly more minimalistic since I am not a movie star ⭐️ but a regular pretty-witty girl who’s not next door 😅
@madhavsharma2785,I feel after pregnancy she has ignored her skin 😢 I can't see the natural glow which she had.
@raunaasumheraerfan,best routine and productsss
@radhikakumari7758,natural beauty queen alia most beautiful heroine in the world love you alia lots of love❤❤❤❤❤❤
@preetinangla9513,You are looking fab 👍👌

@karant1378,"Bratty Bollywood nepo factory product
Corrupted to the chore."
@karant1378,"Talentless nepo baby
Can't act to save her life"
@comillalaban1649,It is not about whiteness it is about beautiful features.  Deepika is a beauty as she is internationally recognised as the most beautiful woman .  Features outstanding. Wish I could look even have 1 feature like her
@poojalakshmi4683,"Your innocence at 30s is what I like the most. The blah when you opened the milk highlighter, loved it, cute 😊"
@roshnipatel7978,Did she just call it a blush instead of a brush at 1:19 ??
@dhvnixyoutubeautyx7611,She being one of the top Indian celebrities mentions all the products she uses in her makeup/skincare videos and then there are these small time so called “celebrities” who already have some makeup done before they even get started with the routine and won’t even mention the product names as if people will start copying them. I am not a big fan of Alia Bhatt but my respect for her has grown.
@dreamz_fulfilled2205,"She shared name of all the brands she uses, and I love that ❤"
@reginarai2789,My favourite only Alia Bhatt she is my favourite and Ranbir Kapoor ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

@samikshalakshmi9734,What lipstick shade is that?
@mythologicalmainstay5029,"You are delusional if you think that  she doesn’t have a bit of makeup on maybe some lip and cheek tint 

Also she is so hated because she doesn’t deserve to be where she is with her mediocre acting skills. 

No matter how many kids she has no matter no badly her movies do, KJO and Mahesh Bhatt will ensure that she continues to get more movies and publicity to stay in the limelight.

Only thing she has going for her is KJO promoting her to no end while putting down outsiders like Sushanti and Kartick aggressively"

@Tenzinengsel,I don't usually comment on celebrity but I respect her for  always not shying  away and chose to show her natural face without any face filter app.  Very few celebrities has guts to show no make up face  during offscreen and that's the reason I  always  will admire her more  for being her self. For real I always observe  her mostly  with no make up during off screen.
